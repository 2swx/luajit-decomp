LuaJIT decompiler (or more of a bytecode re-assembler)
======================================================

Here's a thing I done made that re-assembles LuaJIT from it's assembly-bytecode (or when used with LuaJIT itself can decompile LuaJIT files)


## If you have any questions on how to use it then read the wiki ##

## Currently I'm busy with real world bits, but here's my current working version ##
Still need to add:
* if statement handling
* table lookups
* uget lookups (if thats possible?)

By using this you agree that you will not modify anything for malicious purposes, or redistribute source code (decompiled or not) of any game using LuaJIT
